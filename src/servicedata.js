We have a group of designers who aim to use this approach as much as possible because our customer's needs are very important to us. Research on the other hand is used as a priliminary step to understand what consumers need or desire to do easier, faster, cheaper, or more effectively. We make sure we have the right idea before implementing something and we do our research efficiently. ",

      "Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the userâ€™s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. A majority of web applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and HTML5. Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an application-like experience within a Web browser.Containerization and Orchestration involve bundling an application together with all of its related configuration files, libraries and dependencies required for it to run in an efficient and bug-free way across different computing environments and platforms.",
